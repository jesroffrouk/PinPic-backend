#  PinPic

> *Share memories where they belong — in the places that made them special.*

---
> Building digital experiences that make people *feel connected.* 

## Overview

**PinPic** is a social platform where users can **bind images to specific locations** on the map.  
Whenever someone visits that place, they can **discover memories**, photos, and moments shared by others — making every spot more meaningful and personal.

💬 Think of it as *Instagram meets Google Maps*, where every pin tells a story.

## Core Idea

> Create a world where places hold stories — not just coordinates.

Each image on PinPic is **geographically tied** to a real location.  
Anyone visiting that same area can **view photos shared nearby**, forming a map of authentic memories and experiences.
